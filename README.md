## ðŸš€ Overview

`applogger` is a **structured logging library** for Go that writes logs in **NDJSON format** (Newline Delimited JSON).

- **Structured Logging**: Outputs logs in JSON format for easy parsing.
- **Log Levels**: Supports Debug, Info, Warn, Error, and Fatal.
- **Concurrency Safe**: Uses mutex locking for safe concurrent writes.
- **Automatic Caller Info**: Captures the package and function where the log originated.
- **HTTP Logging**: Supports logging HTTP response codes and request durations.
- **Context-Aware Logging**: Supports extracting key-value pairs from `context.Context`.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures log files are properly closed on termination.
